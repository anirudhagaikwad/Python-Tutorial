""""
Building an iterator from scratch is easy in Python. We just have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__().
The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.
The __next__() method must return the next item in the sequence. On reaching the end, and in subsequent calls, it must raise StopIteration

Power exponent starts from zero up to a user set number
